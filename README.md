# CafChemTeach
A library and notebooks and such for the Module: *Python, Machine Learning and AI for Chemistry*

For instructions on using Ollama for LLMs, see the [Ollama page](https://github.com/MauricioCafiero/CafChemTeach/blob/main/using_ollama.md) <br>
For some basic Python concepts, see the [common Python techniques](https://github.com/MauricioCafiero/CafChemTeach/blob/main/tips_one_liners.md)<br>

## Demonstrate Transformer encoders and decoders
- A sample notebook shows how decoders generate text autoregressively. Can be used with any model on Huggingface. Also shows how encoders fill in masked words.

## Introduction to RDKit
- A sample notebook shows how to use RDKit to explore molecules and molecular properties, including applications to medicinal chemistry. 

## Featurize molecules and train SciKit-learn models
- A sample notebook shows how to featurize lists of SMILES strings using RDKit descriptors and how to then fit that data using models from SciKit-learn

## Featurize molecules and train a Multilayer perceptron using PyTorch
- A sample notebook shows how to featurize lists of SMILES strings using RDKit descriptors and how to then fit that data using a neural netowrk in PyTorch

## Simple chatbot using the OpenAI GPT-OSS-20B open weights model
- Chat with OpenAI's open model. A second version of the notebook includes the reasoning trace in a separate textbox.
