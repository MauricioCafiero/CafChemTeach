# CafChemTeach
A library and notebooks and such for the Module: *Python, Machine Learning and AI for Chemistry*

For some basic Python concepts, see the [Tips and one-liners](https://github.com/MauricioCafiero/CafChemTeach/blob/main/tips_one_liners.md)<br>

## Demonstrate Transformer encoders and decoders
- A sample notebook shows how decoders generate text autoregressively. Can be used with any model on Huggingface. Also shows how encoders fill in masked words.

## Featurize molecules and train SciKit-learn models
- A sample notebook shows how to featurize lists of SMILES strings using RDKit descriptors and how to then fit that data using models from SciKit-learn
