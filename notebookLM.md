# NotebookLM

Google's NotebookLM is an easy way to interact with documents using the Gemini LLM. It will allow you to query the documents using the chabot 
(much like RAG), as well as create mindmaps and audio and video overviews of the material. 

### How to get and use NotebookLM
- if you have a Google account, you automatically have acess to NotebookLM. Visit: https://notebooklm.google.com
- Upload or add (from Google Drive) documents you want to be part of the notebook. You will almost instantly be able to chat with your documents via the Gemini powered chatbot.
- Generate an audio or video overview in the style of a podcast! (this may take a while!)
- Generate a mindmap. This takes considerably less time!
